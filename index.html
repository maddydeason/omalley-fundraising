        <h3 class="number">1. O’Malley is spending at a higher rate than his competitors</h3>
        <div class="show-for-medium-up"><iframe src="charts/stack-onhand.html" frameborder="0" width="620" height="490"></iframe></div>
        <div class="show-for-small-only"><iframe src="charts/stack-onhand-small.html" frameborder="0" width="620" height="420"></iframe></div>
        <p>The $1.28 million Martin O’Malley’s campaign raised from July 1 to September 30 reflects a 36 percent drop from the $2 million he raised in the second quarter. While his fundraising fell, the two Democratic frontrunners, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, saw an increase in contributions. Clinton raised $29.9 million while Sanders brought in $26.2 million. But even worse for O’Malley is the rate at which he’s burning through his money.  O’Malley has spent 75 percent of the money he has raised since beginning his campaign, and had just $806,000 cash on hand at the end of September. Clinton has spent 57 percent of her total fundraising so far, and still has $33 million in the bank. Sanders has spent 35 percent of his total fundraising and has $27 million on hand.</p>
        <p>“The idea that he can - either with the 1.3 million that he raised or the 800,000 he has on hand - even create a national profile, he’s not going to do it,” said Todd Eberly, chair of the political science department at St. Mary’s College of Maryland.</p>

        <h3 class="number">2. O’Malley is relying heavily on his home state for fundraising</h3>

        <p>As O’Malley has struggled to gain name recognition on the national stage, he has continued to raise the vast majority of his funds from Maryland. Roughly 32 percent of his third-quarter donations came from his home state, down slightly from 35 percent in the 2nd quarter. But O’Malley still is much more dependent on Marylanders than Clinton is on New Yorkers (12 percent) and Sanders is on Vermonters (0.9 percent).</p>
        <p>“It just happens to be his home state and home to many wealthy people and he has got many connections. But relying on that is not going to propel his candidacy,” Eberly said. “He needed to start building a national donor database that would suggest his name recognition is rising and suggest that there are folks supporting him outside of Maryland.”</p>

        <h3 class="number">4. The O’Malley campaign had a substantial last-minute fundraising blitz</h3>
        <div class="show-for-medium-up"><iframe src="charts/line-contribs.html" frameborder="0" width="620" height="480"></iframe></div>
        <div class="show-for-small-only"><iframe src="charts/line-contribs-small.html" frameborder="0" width="620" height="410"></iframe></div>
        <p>In the final three days of the third-quarter filing period, the O’Malley campaign raised $211,449, more than 17 percent of its three-month total. More than half of that sum came on the final day of the quarter. The campaign emailed at least four fundraising appeals in the final three days, which lamented the need to ask for money but clearly seem to have accomplished the goal of giving a last-minute boost to the bank account.</p>

        <h3 class="number">5. O’Malley is not spending much on advertising</h3>

        <p>A lack of national media attention has hampered O’Malley’s ability to gain name recognition, compounded by his inability to spend large amounts on media outreach and advertising. Since his announcement, the campaign has spent $144,000 on digital advertising, media services, website design and video production combined, totaling just 6 percent of overall expenditures. The bulk of the spending, roughly 38 percent, has gone to staff salaries and payroll taxes.</p>
